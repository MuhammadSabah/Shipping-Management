# Shipping Management System

## 1. Description
   The “Shipping Management System” is a system used for proper management of containers in a shipping company. The customer submits orders through shipping company      branches anywhere. These orders are collected at the closest port, and all product types are then loaded into the container and shipped to the destination port. The    container will be opened in the closest port, and all the products were sent to the correct customer locations.
