# Shipping Management System

## About
This project is our final project for Advanced Computer Programming (ACP) class supervised by Dr. Polla Fattah. 
We will be working on this project as team of 5,
and will use Waterfall model as the software development life cycle (SDLC) to easily manage each phase and keep track of our progress.

## 1. Description
   The “Shipping Management System” is a system used for proper management of containers in a shipping company. The customer submits orders through shipping company      branches anywhere. These orders are collected at the closest port, and all product types are then loaded into the container and shipped to the destination port. The    container will be opened in the closest port, and all the products were sent to the correct customer locations.

## 3. Non-functional requirements

<ol type="I">
   <li>
    <strong>
      Usability:
    </strong>
   Regardless of the size of the business, the system should be easy to use for even a non-technical user.
   </li>
   <li>
     <strong>
      Maintainablity:
     </strong>
         The software system should be maintainable, repairable and improvable, this phase in the software development cycle starts after the customer has received the          product.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>
        Reliability:
      </strong>
Software reliability, cost effectiveness and support services using appropriate technologies and expertise for enhancing our clients ability to serve their customers better.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>
        Scalability:
      </strong>
The software system should be scalable for our clients organization, so that it’s adjustable to changing market conditions and workloads.
   </li>
   <li>
      <strong>
         Security:
      </strong>
As far as the software and hardware is concerned, the proposed
system must be completely reliable with data security.
   </li>
</ol>

## 6. Intended Audience
#### This system is for:
   - A **Small** or **Medium** Shipping Company


## 7. System Requirements

| For Hardware | For Software | 
|--------------|--------------|
| Personal Computers (PC) or Desktop          | Windows 8, 10 & 11       |   
| Laptops      |              | 
   
## 8. Milestones & Deadlines

We expect to finish the project within a period of 2½ months then we can deploy it on market, but support for adding more features, maintainability of the software and keeping the software up-to-date with the market requirements requires more budget and time.
